# Gesture_Control
"A python and OpenCV based project that helps you to navigate through your device no matter what OS it is."

A Python and OpenCV-based project that enables control through hand gestures. By using computer vision, this program detects hand movements and translates them into operational commands, allowing you to interact with the system hands-free.
Features:

    Detects hand gestures in real-time using OpenCV.
    Simple and intuitive hand motion control.
    Fully responsive and customizable gesture recognition.

Technologies:

    Python
    OpenCV

Usage:

This project can be used for gesture-based navigation, contactless control systems, or even games that require hand gesture inputs.
